THIS DIR helps in setting up the db schema

All the db schema files should go in db_schema directory

Naming Convention to be followed:
1. Name the files
  <table-name>.table.php
  eg. users.table.php <-- File which creates users table
2. Each file should have a class where 
  ClassName == ucfirst ( <table-name> )
  eg. class Users {} <-- should be present in users.table.php
3. These classes should implement 'create' & 'destroy' method. Both methods must be public
